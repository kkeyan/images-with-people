# images-with-people-extractor
Python program to separate images with people in it from a cluster of dump of photos

Often we encounter a entire directory full of photos of various things and it's tedious to separate the ones we want(of people) from the entire pile.
The program takes in two parametres a source folder and a destination folder.
The source folder is where all the iages are present.
The destination folder where the images are to be stored.
The program uses Python3 and opencv library which has to be installed separately.
